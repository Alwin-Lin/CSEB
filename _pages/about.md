## Our story
Computer Science for Equity & Beyond (CSEB) was founded April 2021 by Alwin Lin after seeing the impact that COVID had on work space. Our goal is to lower the entry barrier to coding by using the power of cloud computing, allowing students from all backround to join in with just a single laptop and internet connection.

Right now, additional modues that focuses on Android application development is currently being developed, we are also looking into potential ways to make it easier for students to perform the codelab with either phone or tablets, stay tuned for more updates.
