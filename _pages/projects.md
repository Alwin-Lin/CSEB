Here are the three major projects in development/testing, all of which can be completed with a computer, browser, and internet connection.

### Android system development on Cloud code lab
Spanning from code lab 1~3, these code labs cover the basics of a Virtual Machine on Google Cloud Platform, the basics of Android system development, as well as introductory computer science. After finishing this section, students will have an elementary understanding of Cloud computing, and a functional VM on GCP

### Website building for non-profits 
The project is currently underway. To introduce more people into IT, we are looking to train volunteers on building websites for non-profits in need. The volunteers will gain real-world experience with a finished product to show for, and the organizations will gain a new website.
