Here are the three major projects that are in development/testing, all of which can be completed with a computer, browser, and internet connection.

### Andorid system development on Cloud code lab
Spanning from code lab 1~3, these code labs sets up the student to engage in later code labs. Covering the setup of a Virtual Machine(VM) on Google Cloud Platform(GCP), the basics of Android system development, as well as some introductory computer science. Finishing this section, students will have a elementry understanding of Cloud computing, and a funcitonal VM setup on GCP

### Debugging and analizing artifacts
Picking up from Android system development on cloud, code lab 4 will show the students how to setup and debug applications using Compatibility Test Suite(CTS), code lab 5 focuses on streamlineing the process with GCP, as well as analizing the artifacts produced.

### Build your own development environment at scale
Code lab 6 circles back to begining, going through the details of building and distribuiting customized development enviroments.
